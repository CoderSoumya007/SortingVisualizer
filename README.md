# SortingVisualizer
In this project, I have tried to Visualize how different Sorting Algorithms work in Data Structures and Algorithms. U can watch the sorting process at your required Speed.
The  Cool part of the project is to take a Big array, maximize speed, and see how the different Algorithms sort the huge array in minimum time.
