# SortingVisualizer
In this project I have tried to Visualize how diffent Sorting Algorithms works in Data Structures and Algorithms. U can watch the sorting process as per your required Speed.
The  Cool part of the prooject- take a Big array,maximise speed and see how the different Algorithms sort the huge array in minimum time.
